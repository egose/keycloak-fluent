# General Example

This example demonstrates a full end-to-end setup using `keycloak-fluent`. It shows how to authenticate against the master realm, create and configure a custom realm, and then provision common Keycloak resources such as users, roles, groups, clients, service accounts, and protocol mappers using a fluent, chainable API.

The snippet is intentionally comprehensive to illustrate how different building blocks fit together in a real-world scenario. In practice, you would typically split this logic across smaller scripts or services depending on your provisioning needs.
